# Mini Data-Analysis Descriptions

#### What is the project?
##### Milestone 1
This is a collaborative project for STAT 545A, called Milestone 1. It's purpose is to orient students on how to collaborate using R, Git and Github. Students also learned about version control and how to troubleshoot coding errors.

##### Milestone 2
This is a collaborative project for STAT 545A, called Milestone 2. It's purpose is to continue to orient students on how to collaborate using R, Git and Github. The main purpose was to practice troubleshooting and correcting errors within R code.

#### What files are in the Project Folder/Repository
Within "collaborative-group9" you will find 8 files: README.md, .gitignore, collaborative-group9.Rproj, TEAMWORK.md, troubleshooting-1.Rmd,  troubleshooting-1.md, troubleshooting-2.Rmd, and troubleshooting-2.md

##### Repository 
- README.md contains a thorough description on the content that can be found in this repository. The README.md file can also be used to produce a PDF or html

- .gitignore specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore

- collaborative-group9.Rproj contains project options and can also be used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the file system 

##### Milestone 1 Folder
- TEAMWORK.md is the code that was written on Rstudio to produce a PDF or html

- troubleshooting-1.Rmd is an R markdown file that was taken from the STAT545A website and the errors were corrected

- troubleshooting-1.md is the file that was rendered from knitting troubleshooting-1.Rmd

##### Milestone 2 Folder
- Troubleshooting-2.Rmd is an R markdown file that was taken from the STAT545A website. Errors contained in this file were corrected by students as part of Milestone 2
 
- Troubleshooting-2.md is the file that was rendered from knitting troubleshooting-2.Rmd which helped us determine whether our corrections to the errors were successful

#### How to run the code in the folder
Open Rstudio and start a new project. Link this new project to the collaborative-group9 repository on github by copying the url that can be found in the repository on github to the Rstudio window that opens. Pull the files and run code by highlighting the desired code and click run.
